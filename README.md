This repository contains a simple example demonstrating a React class component with state management and event handling.  
Files  


# App.js: 
The main application component that renders a greeting and the Comp1 component. It passes a name prop to Comp1. 

# components/Comp1.js: 
A class component that displays the name prop and manages a state variable age. This component includes a button that increments the age by 5 each time itâ€™s clicked. 
# Key Concepts  

# Props : 
Comp1 receives a name prop from App.js. 
# State: 
Comp1 uses the age state initialized to 20. 
# Event Handling:
The handleUpdate method updates the age state when the button is clicked, demonstrating state manipulation in class components.
